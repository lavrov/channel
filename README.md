# Coursier channel

Descriptors for my cli apps.

```sh
$ coursier channel --add https://git.io/JTxCg
$ coursier install src
```

*Note:*
In order for installation to work you need github access token with _read:packages_ permission.
Token will not be required when [this issue](https://github.community/t/download-from-github-package-registry-without-authentication/14407) is solved.
